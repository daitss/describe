# This is an example of the DAITSS configuration file restricted to
# the data necessary to run the describe service.
#
# You must set up your web server to set the environment variable
# DAITSS_CONFIG to point to a configuration file along these lines,
# though typically it will have sections for many services in addition
# to this one.
#
# Please don't use tabs in this file.

defaults:

# We normally name sections after the virtual hostname used by an
# applcation (this is so one physical host can run multiple services
# of the same kind).  An application's configuration code typically
# checks the VIRTUAL_HOSTNAME environment variable to determine the
# appropriate section to load.  Typically VIRTUAL_HOSTNAME is set in
# the same place that the DAITTS_CONFIG environment is set.
